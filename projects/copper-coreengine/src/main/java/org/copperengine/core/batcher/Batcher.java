/**
 * A batcher is a service that collects homogeneous tasks over a period of time and executes them as a batch.
 * This may increase dramatically the throughput for a kind of tasks.
 * A typical usage for the Batcher is database batching. It collects simple insert, update oder delete statements
 * and executes them as a batch. This increases throughput mostly by a factor of 10 or more.
 * Of course, batching may lead to longer latency times.
