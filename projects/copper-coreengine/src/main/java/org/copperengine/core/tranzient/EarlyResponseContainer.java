 * A transient container for early response. In the context of COPPER, a reponse is called early, if an asynchronous
 * response
 * is provided to an engine using <code>notify</code> before the workflow has called <code>wait</code>.
 * In this case the engine is unable to correlate the response with a waiting workflow instance and will store the
 * response in this container. Later on, the engine will ask the container for every <code>wait</code> if a response for
 * this
 * wait is already there. In this case the response is removed from the container.
 * The container may implement a strategy to remove reponses for which no wait from a corresponding workflow instance is
 * called.
